My thoughts on the positives and negatives of working in a group.

I really enjoyed working on this project in a group environment, as it meant we could all collect our ideas and end up creating a very successful final program. We all demonstrated different skills and understand of certain things, and this meant we could all contribute and put forward ideas. We all contributed a lot in all aspects; writing code, ideas, encouraging and motivating each other to do the work. Making a Facebook group chat was definitely a good idea as when we weren't working on it together in person, we could talk about it in the group chat.

The only negative I personally found was finding time to meet as a group to complete the assignment. We managed to find time on Saturday's so it ended up working out well, but we were worried that we wouldn't find time during the week, but we worked so efficiently that we didn't need to.

Overall I really enjoyed working with my group and we ended up creating a very good project and had lots of laughs along the way.
